It will also describe the structure and roles of each party involved and how <br>
communication will be held between those involved.

## **2.1. External Interfaces**

Communication between the parties involved in this project, the ones working on <br>
this project, and the one overseeing this project will happen via google mail or <br>
google hangout at undefined times. There will also be various face-to-face <br>
communications at undefined times

## **2.2. Internal Structure**

The parties working on this project, Alex Hannen and Chandler Fletcher, will be <br>
equal in terms of authority, responsibility, and position in this project.

## **2.3. Roles and Responsibilities**

- Student 1 - Alex Hannen
- Student 2 - Chandler Fletcher

Current project stakeholders include Professor Russel Glaue. The stakeholder role<br>
in this project will be to judge the current state of the project after each milestone. <br>
The schedule of these will be conjoint with the schedule of each milestone completion <br>
listed in section 1 of this document.

# **3. Managerial Process Plans**

This section will provide information on different plans that include the project and staff.

## **3.1. Start-Up Plans**

We first created a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document to help <br>
determine what this project will require. Use Cases, class diagrams, sequence <br>
diagrams will also be created to help with this process. These diagrams can be <br>
found in the SRS diagram. After completion of these tasks, the project will move <br>
into the development phase which is more explained through the gantt charts.

### **3.1.1. Estimation Plan**

To better understand the resources, project size, effort, cost and scheduling and <br>
any other requirements that our project would be subjected to, we decided to use <br>
the Function Point Estimation tool to help us better understand how taxing this <br>
project would be.. We also incorporated the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) to <br>
better understand the effort and schedule that would be required of us.
### <br>**__put pictures here___**

### **3.1.2. Staffing Plan**

Per section 2.3, current staff will only include Alex Hannen and Chandler Fletcher. <br>
Each Staff will be needed for 8 months for this project. Both staff will be required <br>
to have some basic programming knowledge. Assignments and candidates selected for <br>
said assignments will be decided at the date the assignments are announced to the <br>
discretion of both staffs.

### **3.1.3. Staff Training Plan**

If any staff involved in the project do not have any programming experience, then <br>
they will be required to gain some basic programming knowledge on their own time. <br>
No other training will be required.

### **3.1.4. Resource Acquisition Plan**

Two computers capable of running task intensive resources will be required. <br>
Computers will be required to have JAVA and an IDE that is capable of using the <br>
Swing library. Internet Connection will also be required for communication efforts. <br>
Staff listed in Section 2.3 will be required to bring their own resources. Any <br>
resources that can not be acquired by the staff own means can be resolved by going <br>
to the Computer Lab in STIPES hall.

## **3.2. Work Plan**

A more detailed work plan can be seen on the project gantt chart. For the entirety <br>
of the project, there will be a fixed amount of staff as specified in Section 2.3. <br>
Resources required are detailed in Section 3.1.4 and are unlikely to change. The <br>
entire duration of this project is estimated to be about 8 month. As specified in <br>
Section 3.3.4, there is no budget for this project and that is unlikely to change.

## **3.3. Control Plan**

This document and the control plans below should be reassessed and updated with <br>
each weekly meeting for the project.

### **3.3.1. Data Control Plan**

**Github Link:**

[https://github.com/cf-eli/go-fish](https://github.com/cf-eli/go-fish)

The project will be Managed using Git and uploaded to GitHub in a shared repository.

- Project files will be managed within this repository.
- Project plans and management documentation will be included in this repository.

### **3.3.2. Requirements Control Plan**

Requirements will be evaluated on each team meeting and a decision will be made <br>
if the team is meeting the requirements for each phase of the project. If a <br>
requirement is changed and needs to be conveyed immediately, the discord group <br>
should be notified asap.

    1.
### **3.3.3. Schedule Control Plan**

**Gantt chart link:**

[https://prod.teamgantt.com/gantt/schedule/?ids=2980548#&amp;ids=2980548&amp;<br>user=&amp;custom=&amp;company=&amp;hide\_completed=false&amp;date\_filter=&amp;color\_filter=](https://prod.teamgantt.com/gantt/schedule/?ids=2980548#&amp;ids=2980548&amp;user=&amp;custom=&amp;company=&amp;hide_completed=false&amp;date_filter=&amp;color_filter=)

The project will be using a gantt chart to track and monitor the progress of the<br>
software. If progress falls behind on<br> scheduled time restraints, schedules will<br>
be reevaluated and updated promptly with a notification to the group discord.

### **3.3.4. Budget Control Plan**

There is currently no budget to be monitored for Go Fish.

### **3.3.5. Communication, Tracking, and Reporting Plan**

Communication between members will primarily be through the weekly team meetings, <br>
and interpersonally thorough discord. If sufficient changes need to be made that <br>
need to be discussed immediately , they should be communicated with thoughts and <br>
notes through that channel.

| **Type of Communication** | **Communication Schedule** | **Typical Communication Mechanism** | **Who Initiates** | **Recipient** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Status Report | every Friday | team meeting | scheduled | everyone |
| Schedule and Effort Tracking Report | weekly | discord | Hannen | Fletcher |
| Project Review | monthly | During team meeting | scheduled | everyone |
| Risk Mitigation Status | as mitigation actions are completed | discord | responsible team member | everyone |
| Requirement Changes | as changes are approved | discord/email and change control tool | Hannen | affected Project Participants |

### **3.3.6. Metrics Collection Plan**

Metrics should be collected with Netbeans IDE and stored in the proper location <br>
in the project folder

## **3.4. Risk Management Plan**

Risk will be assessed and managed as needed, with discord as a medium for <br>
communication on which risk mitigation actions have been completed.

## **3.5. Issue Resolution Plan**

Issues should be identified and reported in the discord so that we may address them together.

## **3.6. Project Close-Out Plan**

Go Fish should be completed and ready to be presented before the final presentation <br>
date (5-2-22) The repository for the project will remain available on github, for future reference if needed.

# **4. Technical Process Plans**

## **4.1.Process Model**

Go Fish will use an Agile development process model.

## **4.2. Methods, Tools, and Techniques**

Java will be used as the programming language, with a preference for Netbeans as <br>
an IDE. Git will be used as a version control system, which should be paired with <br>
github as the host of the repository. Swing will be used to auto generate the framework <br>
of the GUI. Testing will be performed with Junit.

## **4.3. Configuration Management Plan**

Schedule changes made to the gantt schedule should go through both parties and be <br>
approved before changes should be made, as well as changes to this PMP document <br>
and SRS. All other factors do not need to follow this plan.

## **4.4. Quality Assurance Plan**

QA will be managed by Hannen, and the whole team will be responsible for working<br>
through the tasks presented. There will be specific time allotted leading up to <br>
the completion of the project.

## **4.5. Documentation Plan**

Readme.md will be used to provide installation/running instructions to the end user.

Srs document will be used to provide detailed specifications of the software
<br>PMP will be used to provide the basis for the management of the project.

| **Document** | **Template or Standard** | **Created By** | **Reviewed By** | **Target Date** | **Distribution** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| readme | Standard | Hannen | Fletcher | TBD | TBD |
| SRS | Template | Fletcher | Hannen | 2-21 | TBD |
| PMP | Template | Fletcher | Hannen | 2-21 | TBD |

## **4.6 Process Improvement Plan**

**BASELINE** - Improvements will be made to the systems once the original goal of such is met:

- Easy mode
- One Ai player
- Game working optimally

**STRETCH GOALS** - Stretch goals are of the nature that **should not** affect the <br>
baseline of the game. If they are added, they are extra features that are not needed <br>
for the game to function:

- Condensing game windows for easier game flow
- increased AI difficulty(normal/hard)
- More AI players at once

Stretch goals are to only be attempted once the baseline is deemed complete. Stretch goals <br>should be handled in a way that does not disrupt the baseline.
